# 1. What are the different types of machine learning? 

    # Answer: Supervised and Unsupervised

# 2. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? When would you use one method over another?

    # Answer: Supervised ML deals with labelled data and unsupervised ML deals with unlabelled data. 

# 3. What is overfitting, how can you avoid it?

    # Answer: Overfitting is when our model fits the data we have too well, so that it actually won't perform well on new data.

# 4. What is 'training' and 'test' set in a machine learning model?

    # Answer: This refers to 2 datasets that used to be one. We split data like this when we want to train a model and make sure it doesn't overfit. We train the model
    # on the train data and test it on the test data.

# 5. How can you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset? 

    # Answer: Some options include: removing the variables that are missing data, imputing data, or leaving as is. This depends on several factors, such as domain knowledge,
    # how much data is missing, and what type of model we are using.

# 6. What are some applications of supervised machine learning? 

    # Answer: Regression and classification

# 7. What is the KNN algorithm? (Write a brief description)

    # Answer: KNN is a classification algorithm that aims to label or categorize data based on nearby data points.

# 8. What are advantages of the KNN algorithm? 

    # Answer: KNN is easy to use because it doesn't require many tuning parameters and it is very versatile. It can be used for both classification and regression, and can
    # find patterns in extra complex data.

# 9. What are disadvantages of the KNN algorithm? 

    # Answer: KNN is sensitive to outliers and can be hard to interpret because our resulting model doesn't give us clear rules.
