# Lab 2: Tidying Data

The goal of tidying data is to get data in a format where every variable is a column and every row is an observation, so that the data is easiest to work with. This can vary not only between datasets, but also throughout the analysis process of a single dataset. This is to say that what makes a dataframe tidy is subjective -- it depends largely on domain knowledge and the goal of our analysis.

The Lab includes 2 datasets, airlines and mixed_drink_recipes, which comes in untidy formats and must be tidied, transformed, and analyzed.

**Feature functions: pivot_wider ; pivot_longer ; grepl ; pairwise ; slice ; case_when ; parse number**

**Feature plotting: Cleveland Multiway Dot-Plot + lots and lots of features**
